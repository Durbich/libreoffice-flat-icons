By downloading the files you accept to learn how to do a backflip.
If you know how to backflip, learn front flip.
If you fail to learn any of the flips but continue to use the icons,
I will find you.

JK, here's real:
7 (seven) .svg images from this very repository are:
free to use, free to share, free to modify, free to look at.
Do not sell them. Do not use them as the main part of a paid product.
If used in a proprietary product, there must be a notice that these icons are free as freedom.
If they were fed to an AI and AI can reproduce them, there must be a notice with these very license terms from line 7 to line 13.
